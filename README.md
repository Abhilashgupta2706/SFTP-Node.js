# SFTP using Node.js

## About this project

I made this projects for learning the SFTP using node.js for my project requirement.
I have used Bitvise SSH Server for test purpose. [Click here](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-server-download) to go to the download page.

### Setup & Installtion

Make sure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed.

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

Open the folder in Android Studio and you are good to go.

If you are using Bitvise then first setup Virtual Account from Open Easy Settings option from Settings in Server tab.

Give the path for the files and also config same in the application.
